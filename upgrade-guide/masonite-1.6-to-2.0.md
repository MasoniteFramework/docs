# Masonite 1.6 to 2.0

Masonite 2 brings an incredible new release to the Masonite family. This release brings a lot of new features to Masonite to include new status codes, database seeding, built in cron scheduling, controller constructor resolving, auto-reloading server, a few new internal ways that Masonite handles things, speed improvements to some code elements and so much more. We think developers will be extremely happy with this release.

Upgrading from Masonite 1.6 to Masonite 2.0 shouldn't take very long although it does have the largest amount of changes in a single release. On an average sized project, this upgrade should take around 30 minutes. We'll walk you through the changes you have to make to your current project and explain the reasoning behind it

## Application and Provider Configuration&#x20;

Masonite 2 adds some improvements with imports. Previously we had to import providers and drivers like:

```python
from masonite.providers.UploadProvider import UploadProvider
```

Because of this, all framework [Service Providers](broken-reference) will need to cut out the redundant last part. The above code should be changed to:

```python
from masonite.providers import UploadProvider
```

Masonite 2 brings a more explicit way of declaring Service Providers in your application. You'll need to take your current `PROVIDERS` list inside the `config/application.py` file and move it into a new `config/providers.py` file.

Now all Service Providers should be imported at top of the file and added to the list:

{% code title="config/providers.py" %}
```python
from masonite.providers import (
    AppProvider,
    SessionProvider,
    RouteProvider
)

...

PROVIDERS = [
    # Framework Providers
    AppProvider,
    SessionProvider,
    RouteProvider,
    ....
]
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
String providers will still work but it is not recommended and will not be supported in current and future releases of Masonite.
{% endhint %}

## WSGI changes

There are a few changes in the `wsgi.py` file and the `bootstrap/start.py` file.

In the `wsgi.py` file we should add a new import at the top:

```python
...
# from pydoc import locate - Remove This
...
from config import application, providers
...

container.bind('WSGI', app)
container.bind('Application', application)

# New Additions Here
container.bind('ProvidersConfig', providers)
container.bind('Providers', providers)
container.bind('WSGIProviders', providers)
```

Then change the code logic of bootstrapping service providers from:

{% code title="wsgi.py" %}
```python
for provider in container.make('Application').PROVIDERS:
    locate(provider)().load_app(container).register()

for provider in container.make('Application').PROVIDERS:
    located_provider = locate(provider)().load_app(container)
    if located_provider.wsgi is False:
        container.resolve(locate(provider)().load_app(container).boot)
```
{% endcode %}

to:

{% code title="wsgi.py" %}
```python
 for provider in container.make('ProvidersConfig').PROVIDERS:
    located_provider = provider()
    located_provder.load_app(container).register()
    if located_provider.wsgi:
        container.make('WSGIProviders').append(located_provider)
     else:
        container.resolve(located_provider.boot)
        container.make('Providers').append(located_provider)
```
{% endcode %}

and change the logic in `bootstrap/start.py` to:

{% code title="bootstrap/start.py" %}
```python
for provider in container.make('WSGIProviders'):
    container.resolve(located_provider.boot)
```
{% endcode %}

Notice here we split the providers list when the server first boots up into two lists which significantly lowers the overhead of each request.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This change should significantly boost speed performances as providers no longer have to be located via pydoc. You should see an immediate decrease in the time it takes for the application to serve a request. Rough time estimates say that this change should increase the request times by about 5x as fast.
{% endhint %}

## Duplicate Class Names

Again, with the addition of the above change, any place you have a duplicated class name like:

```python
from masonite.drivers.UploadDriver import UploadDriver
```

You can change it to:

```python
from masonite.drivers import UploadDriver
```

## Redirection

Renamed Request.redirectTo to Request.redirect\_to. Be sure to change any of these instances accordingly.

All instances of:

```python
return request().redirectTo('home')
```

should be changed to:

```python
return request().redirect_to('home')
```

## Redirect Send Method

Also removed the `.send()` method completely on the `Request` class so all instances of:

```python
def show(self):
    return request().redirect('/dashboard/@id').send({'id': league.id})
```

Need to be changed to:

```python
def show(self):
    return request().redirect('/dashboard/@id', {'id': league.id})
```

## CSRF Middleware

Some variable internals have changed to prepend a double underscore to them to better symbolize they are being handled internally. Because of this we need to change any instances of csrf\_token to \_\_token in  the CSRF Middleware file.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can check for what the class should look like from the [MasoniteFramework/masonite](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/masonite) repository
{% endhint %}

## Autoloading

Masonite 2 comes with a new autoloader. This can load all classes in any directory you specify right into the [Service Container](broken-reference) when the server first starts. This is incredibly useful for loading your models, commands or tasks right into the container.

Simply add a new `AUTOLOAD` constant in your `config/application.py` file. This is the entire section of the autoload configuration.

{% code title="config/application.py" %}
```python
'''
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Autoload Directories
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| List of directories that are used to find classes and autoload them into
| the Service Container. This is initially used to find models and load
| them in but feel free to autoload any directories
|
'''

AUTOLOAD = [
    'app',
]
```
{% endcode %}

By default this points to the app directory where models are stored by default but if you moved your models to other directories like app/models or app/admin/models then add those directories to your list:

{% code title="config/application.py" %}
```python
....

AUTOLOAD = [
    'app',
    'app/models',
    'app/admin/models'
]
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be caution that this will autoload all models into the [Service Container](broken-reference) with the class name as the key and the class as the binding.
{% endhint %}

## RedirectionProvider

Because of a minor rewrite of the Request class, we now do not need the RedirectionProvider. You can remove the RedirectionProvider completely in your `PROVIDERS` list.

## StatusCodeProvider

There is a new status code provider which adds support for adding custom status codes and rendering better default status code pages such as 400 and 500 error pages. This should be added right above the StartResponseProvider:

{% code title="config/application.py" %}
```python
PROVIDERS = [
    # Framework Providers
    ...
    'masonite.providers.RouteProvider',
    'masonite.providers.RedirectionProvider',

    # New provider here above StartResponseProvider
    'masonite.providers.StatusCodeProvider',

    'masonite.providers.StartResponseProvider',
    'masonite.providers.WhitenoiseProvider',
    ...
]
```
{% endcode %}

## .env File

The .env got a small upgrade and in order to make the `APP_DEBUG` variable consistent, it should be set to either `True` or `False`. Previously this was set to something like `true` or `false`.

{% code title=".env" %}
```
APP_DEBUG=True
# or
APP_DEBUG=False
```
{% endcode %}

Masonite 2 also removed the `APP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable completely.

## Finished

That's it! You're all done upgrading Masonite 1.6 to Masonite 2.0. Build something awesome!

{% hint style="success" %}
Be sure to read about all the [changes in Masonite 2](../whats-new/masonite-2.0.md) to ensure that your application is completely up to date with many of the latest decisions and be sure to thoroughly test your application. Feel free to open an issue if any problems arise during upgrading.
