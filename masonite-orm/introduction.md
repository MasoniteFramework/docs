# Introduction

Masonite ORM was built for the [Masonite Web Framework](https://www.github.com/masoniteframework/masonite) but is built to work in any Python project. It is heavily inspired by the Orator Python ORM and is designed to be a drop in replacement for Orator. Orator was inspired by Laravel's Eloquent ORM so if you are coming from a framework like Laravel you should see plenty of similiarities between this project and Eloquent.

Masonite ORM is a beatiful implementation that includues models, migrations, a query builder, seeds, command scaffolding, query scopes, eager loading, model relationships and many more features. 

Masonite ORM currently supports MySQL, Maria, Postgres and SQLite databases.
